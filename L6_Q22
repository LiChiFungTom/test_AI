22.	You are given the following code segment which implements the Naïve Bayes algorithm on the dataset ‘Diabetes.csv’. 
Modify the code by changing the algorithm to K-Nearest Neighbours.


# Create a GaussianNB model
from sklearn.naive_bayes import GaussianNB
model = GaussianNB().fit(X_train, y_train)

# Calculate accuracy
model.score(X_test, y_test)


# Build KNN model and compute the accuracy
from sklearn.neighbors import KNeighborsClassifier
clf = KNeighborsClassifier(n_neighbors=3)
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
clf.score(X_test, y_test)
