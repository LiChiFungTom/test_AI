12.	Implement the following task as a CSP with the package python-constraint.
Assign an integer within 101 and 300 inclusively to each of ten people, named ‘A’ to ‘J’. There are four constraints as follows:


from constraint import *

n = 10
problem = Problem()
problem.addVariable(0, [101])
problem.addVariables(range(1, n), range(101, 301))

problem.addConstraint(lambda a, b: a*2 == b, [0, n-1])
for i in range(1, n):
    problem.addConstraint(lambda a, b: a+5 <= b, [i-1, i])

sol = problem.getSolution()
sol = dict(sorted(sol.items()))
print(sol)
